# About me
ðŸ‘‹Hi Iâ€™m Tariq. I changed career paths, changed my country of residence and now Iâ€™m looking to change the future! Home had been Dubai and Regional Sales Manager had been my job. Love paved my emigration to the UK and my passion for Technology led me to a career change and it is my growth mindset, that seeks opportunities to learn and grow that will help me to contribute to the future. I am looking forward to continuing my learning journey, shaping the future, and having fun while I do it. 
- I am excited about working with SoC, putting my collaborative and innovative problem-solving skills to their best use. 
- I am currently embarking on my learning journey with School of Code, where I am learning with the best coders in the industry, to become one of the best.
